# Soil-Crop-Plant-Prediction
IMPROVED PRECISION FARMING APPROACH THROUGH PREDICTION OF SOIL, CROP, AND DISEASE IN PLANTS

This project is designed to predict the most suitable crop or plant for a given soil condition using machine learning algorithms. It leverages real agricultural datasets and models trained for soil type classification, crop recommendation, and more.

---

## Features

- Soil type classification using AI/ML models
- Crop recommendation based on soil nutrients and pH
- Trained using real-world agricultural datasets
- High accuracy, scalable model for practical use
- Simple and extensible codebase

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- (Optional) Streamlit / Django for UI
